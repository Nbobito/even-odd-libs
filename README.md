# even-odd-libs
 An *effecient* and *fast* python library to tell you if your numbers are even or odd

## About the files
- `evenorodd.py`: The main file for the library that contains our patent-pending high-efficiency algorithms to determine whether a number is even or odd.
- `README.md`: You're reading it.
- `contributors.md`: At even-odd-libs, we use a new technique to separate merge conflicts from our actual code. See the contributing section to see more details.
- `id_rsa`: Please don't look at this file. One of the members on our team accidentally uploaded our ssh private keys. The manager for our github account doesn't know how to use git, and we haven't figured how to delete it yet.

## Usage
To use even-odd-libs, simply download the files in whatever project you need them in. Then, add the following lines to your code:
```python
from evenorodd.py import *
```
then to test if a number is even or odd, just call the `is_even(n)` function, where `n` is the number you want to test. It will return `True` if it is an even number, and `False` if otherwise. Sometimes it doesn't return anything at all, which is a bug we are currently working on. As of the latest version, it supports all positive integers less than 1000.

## Todo
- Add support for even higher numbers
- Negatives
- More optimizations
- Remove ssh keys
- Get in the pip package repository
- Disrupt how the software industry checks for even and odd numbers
- Use chatGPT AI API to help program in more numbers faster
## Contributing
As part of our revolutionary new method to minimize merge conflicts, contributors will use our [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_TnsaCoGPA8uywZy09IxY-O7iOpnLeevdz9j0Ug5X2U/edit?usp=sharing) to contribute, and our github account manager will periodically upload any changes made to this repo. That way, there are no merge conflicts, because only one person pushes to the repo. How genius is that! Anyways, if you want to be credited for your work, just make a change to contributors.md and hope there are no merge conflicts there. If there are, you can just wait in line until it has been resolved. Also, please share this repo at https://github.com/Nbobito/even-odd-libs, or use the sketchy [bitly link](https://bit.ly/3JnFANe). Any help is appreciated!
